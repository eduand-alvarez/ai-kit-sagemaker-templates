## Layout of the SageMaker ModelBuild Project Template

You can also use the `sagemaker-pipelines-project.ipynb` notebook to experiment from SageMaker Studio before you are ready to checkin your code.

A description of some of the artifacts is provided below:
<br/><br/>
Your codebuild execution instructions. This file contains the instructions needed to kick off an execution of the SageMaker Pipeline in the CICD system (via CodePipeline). You will see that this file has the fields definined for naming the Pipeline, ModelPackageGroup etc. You can customize them as required.

```
|-- codebuild-buildspec.yml
```

<br/><br/>
Your pipeline artifacts, which includes a pipeline module defining the required `get_pipeline` method that returns an instance of a SageMaker pipeline, a preprocessing script that is used in feature engineering, and a model evaluation script to measure the Mean Squared Error of the model that's trained by the pipeline. This is the core business logic, and if you want to create your own folder, you can do so, and implement the `get_pipeline` interface as illustrated here.

```
|-- pipelines
|   |-- abalone
|   |   |-- evaluate.py
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |-- pipeline.py
|   |   `-- preprocess.py

```
<br/><br/>
Utility modules for getting pipeline definition jsons and running pipelines (you do not typically need to modify these):

```
|-- pipelines
|   |-- get_pipeline_definition.py
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- run_pipeline.py
|   |-- _utils.py
|   `-- __version__.py
```
<br/><br/>
Python package artifacts:
```
|-- setup.cfg
|-- setup.py
```
<br/><br/>
A stubbed testing module for testing your pipeline as you develop:
```
|-- tests
|   `-- test_pipelines.py
```
<br/><br/>
The `tox` testing framework configuration:
```
`-- tox.ini
```
